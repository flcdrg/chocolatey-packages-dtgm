    <summary>Displays the list of DLLs that are automatically injected on every process in your system</summary>
    <description>
DLL injection is a quite common technique used by many programs and utilities, so the fact that you have injected DLLs in your system doesn't mean that something is wrong.

The following type of legitimate programs may use DLL injection technique:

* Programs that listen to keystroke on your systems: Macro recorders, key loggers, and so on...
* Programs that listen to mouse moves and/or change the default mouse behavior. For example: Volumouse utility uses the vlmshlp.dll for listening the mouse wheel moves, and use it for changing the sound volume.
* Debugging and diagnostics tools. For example: Microsoft Spy++ utility
* Security related programs: Firewalls, Antivirus programs, AntiSpyware programs, and so on.
* Programs that are well integrated into Windows environment. For example: Babylon translation software uses CAPTLIB.DLL in order to activate the dictionary with mouse buttons and the keyboard.

In addition to the above list, DLL injection may also be used by malicious programs (Viruses, Trojans, Spywares).
