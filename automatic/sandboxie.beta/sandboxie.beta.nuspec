    <summary>Executes processes in a protected, isolated space, otherwise known as a "sandbox".</summary>
    <description>
A process sandbox helps to manage and limit access permissions a process has to your data.  Use it to safely test new software for usability, safely study behavior of known spyware and malware, or browse the web from a sandboxed browser to completely shield your computer and network from Internet Bad Things.

### Features
* Secure Web Browsing: Running your Web browser under the protection of Sandboxie means that all malicious software downloaded by the browser is trapped in the sandbox and can be discarded trivially.
* Enhanced Privacy: Browsing history, cookies, and cached temporary files collected while Web browsing stay in the sandbox and don't leak into Windows.
* Secure E-mail: Viruses and other malicious software that might be hiding in your email can't break out of the sandbox and can't infect your real system.
* Windows Stays Lean: Prevent wear-and-tear in Windows by installing software into an isolated sandbox.

### Shareware; free for personal, non-commercial use. 
* After 30 days, nag screen appears that may be dismissed temporarily. 
* Limited to one sandbox at a time 
* Only software explicitly requested is run in the sandbox (sandboxed programs must be started from Sandboxie program rather than optionally intercepted on the fly)
* Personal-use license for usage on (1) computer is €15 euros/year.
* Commercial-use license for usage on (1) business computer is €41 euros/year.

### Note
* December 2013, Sandboxie was acquired by computer security firm Invincea.
