    <summary>KeePass 2 plugin to provide support for a custom placeholder</summary>
    <description>
MicrosoftKeyImporter is a KeePass 2.x plugin to provide support for a placeholder `{PICKCUSTOMFIELD}`.

When auto-typing a sequence containing this placeholder, a window is displayed that allows to pick a custom string field (whose value is then inserted at the placeholder's position).

#### Purpose
On some sites, particularly banking related sites, there are login forms where you have to enter "The answer for security question 3 out of 5". In KeePass, you probably have stored these answers in custom fields.

With the current `{PICKCHARS}` placeholder you can pick single chars out of a field. But for this use case you need a placeholder for a complete field value.

#### Usage
Just use the new placeholder `{PICKCUSTOMFIELD}` in an Auto-Type sequence. When you execute such a sequence, a window will popup and let you choose a custom field (just like `{PICKCHARS}` does). The value of the picked custom field will be replaced in the Auto-Type sequence.
