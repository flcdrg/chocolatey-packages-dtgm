LibreCrypt (formerly DoxBox) is based on the discontinued FreeOTFE project. Under the licence of FreeOTFE any derived project has to have a new name. The main driver is still known as the 'FreeOTFE Driver', and driver filenames contain 'FreeOTFE' because it was not required to change these to conform to the licence.

LibreCrypt supports the LUKs and losetup encryption schemes that are in most Linux distributions including secure ones used by enterprise, govt's and militaries.
