Obtain information about a system.

PsInfo is a command-line tool that gathers key information about the local or remote Windows NT/2000 system, including the type of installation, kernel build, registered organization and owner, number of processors and their type, amount of physical memory, the install date of the system, and if its a trial version, the expiration date.

#### Command line usage

By default _PsInfo_ shows information for the local system. Specify a remote computer name to obtain information from the remote system. Since _PsInfo_ relies on remote Registry access to obtain its data, the remote system must be running the Remote Registry service and the account from which you run _PsInfo_ must have access to the HKLM\System portion of the remote Registry.

In order to aid in automated Service Pack updates, _PsInfo_ returns as a value the Service Pack number of system (e.g. 0 for no service pack, 1 for SP 1, etc).

__psinfo__ [[\\computer[,computer[,..] | @file [-u user  [-p psswd]]] [-h] [-s] [-d] [-c [-t delimiter]] [filter]

__\\computer__    Perform the command on the remote computer or computers specified. If you omit the computer name the command runs on the local system, and if you specify a wildcard (\\*), the command runs on all computers in the current domain.

__@file__    Run the command on each computer listed in the text file specified.

__-u__    Specifies optional user name for login to remote computer.

__-p__    Specifies optional password for user name. If you omit this you will be prompted to enter a hidden password.

__-h__    Show list of installed hotfixes.

__-s__    Show list of installed applications.

__-d__    Show disk volume information.

__-c__    Print in CSV format.

__-t__    The default delimiter for the -c option is a comma, but can be overriden with the specified character.

__filter__    Psinfo will only show data for the field matching the filter. e.g. "psinfo service" lists only the service pack field.
