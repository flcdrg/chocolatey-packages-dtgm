    <description>
	An Integrated Development Environment for Java, developed mainly for educational purposes, but also suitable for small-scale software development.
	
	It was developed to support the learning and teaching of object-oriented programming, and its design differs from other development environments as a result.

	###Notes

	It includes JDK (7 I think).
