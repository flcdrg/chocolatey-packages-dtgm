Psiphon Circumvention System is an [open source](https://psiphon.ca/en/open-source.html#content) relay-based Internet censorship circumventer.

The system consists of a client application, which configures a users computer to direct Internet traffic; and a set of servers, which proxy client traffic to the Internet. As long as a client can connect to a Psiphon server, it can access Internet services that may be blocked to the user via direct connection.

#### Design goals
* The Internet is not World Wide if someone somewhere is denied access.
* The right to freedom of opinion and expression affects us all, even if censorship does not.

#### Security note
To accomplish its design goals, Psiphon uses computer security technology including encryption and digital signatures. Using these algorithms does not mean Psiphon 3 offers additional security properties such as privacy or authentication of destination sites for users' Internet traffic.

For additional information about how Psiphon works, please see the [FAQ](https://psiphon.ca/en/faq.html#content).

#### Cloud service client
Psiphon is a program that uses various tunnelling technologies to securely connect to a cloud service. Please be aware that this program is anti-censorship and does not guarantee privacy. To determine what information is collected by your usage of the service and how it may be used, please see the [privacy policy](https://psiphon.ca/en/privacy.html#content).

#### Package
* This package does not get upgraded corresponding to the Psiphon program. Instead,
* Upon starting Psiphon, the program will automatically look for digitally signed upgrades through the encrypted tunnel it creates. However,
* If this program is used infrequently, you may also want to periodically upgrade Psiphon manually by forcing a reinstall of this package. This can be done with `-f` or `--force` parameter. E.g. `choco upgrade psiphon --force`
* Checksums are currently not verified for this program upon install.
